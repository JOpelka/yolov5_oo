## ðŸ§¬ What is YOLO_oo?

YOLO_oo (YOLO for Oocyte Observation) is a deep learning model trained on annotated datasets of **mole rat oocytes** under various lab conditions. This project adapts the well-established YOLOv5 architecture to a very specific and niche biological use case, allowing researchers to:

- Detect oocytes automatically in high-resolution microscope images.
- Reduce manual annotation time.
- Improve objectivity and repeatability of experiments.
- Accelerate lab workflows involving gamete classification or counting.
